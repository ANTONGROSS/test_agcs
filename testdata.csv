Whole Foods in Dayton is our newest client, and they have kept us busy! We are the premier “Local” jam, and it’s pretty funny to see my picture on the store shelf. Jessica took that picture by the cannery, and for a phone camera, it did the trick! The model could’ve been better, but the picture is good… Here I am at the Whole Foods Opening Day, giving samples.
Greetings from the Cannery…
Nestled in the green, rolling farmlands of Ohio, a small Summer Kitchen faces south to catch the warm rays of the sun. In this kitchen, jam pots bubble merrily as swaying ceiling fans whisk away the steam and heavy heat. Fragrant raspberries, gentle peaches, and sweet, crisp apples from the farmer down the road vie for dominance in a world where smell, taste, color, and texture mean everything.
This little Summer Kitchen celebrates the seasons with fruit. In the deep winter, give your Valentine a jar of Sweetheart Spread, full of aphrodisiacs: strawberries, cinnamon, cayenne, and Evan Williams’ Honey Bourbon!
In the spring, Rhubarb and Strawberry Jam and plain Rhubarb Jam rule the kitchen.
Finally the summer fruits arrive: delicate Peach Jam,  Strawberry Jam, Blackberry Jam, and the indomitable Raspberry Jam. June is also the month we begin making Christmas Jam (our best seller) in earnest! This is a dizzying blend of blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries! July brings 4th of July Jam: black raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries!
In August the harvest begins in earnest, producing a wild palate of flavors and dizzying colors: Apricot and Honey Jam, Black Plum Preserves, and Peach Pecan Whiskey Jam – almost too much for the hungry soul to bear!
Finally the calming fall arrives with soothing Apple Cider Butter and Apple Cinnamon Conserve.";homepage

In the 1970s, Bob and Sara Rothschild moved from California to Ohio’s Mad River Valley, determined to work the land.

That one simple ingredient inspired our original recipes and unique flavor combinations.

We never settle for just good enough – only the insanely flavorful and truly exceptional.

Trappist Preserves;"Trappist Preserves. . .

A Tradition of Excellence. . .





The monks at St. Joseph's Abbey craft each batch of Trappist Preserves in accord with the monastic tradition of excellence. Excellence begins with the monastery's long-time fruit buyer. Decades of experience guide him to fruit harvested at the peak of freshness. He also insists on the perfect combination of fruit. In the Strawberry Preserves, for example, two kinds of strawberries are selected -- one for outstanding flavor and the other for superb texture which remains throughout cooking.




The tradition of excellence is sustained by the same cook who has been refining recipes and techniques for more than 30 years. He brings a wealth of experience and continuity to every batch of Trappist Preserves. Years of experience led the monks to the technique of vacuum pan cooking. This process cooks fruit at temperatures of about 80 degrees cooler than other methods, resulting in better color and superior flavor. No artificial colorings, flavors or preservatives are ever used in Trappist Preserves!





A combination of refined sugar and natural (NOT high fructose) corn syrup is used to sweeten and preserve the fruit; each adds something to the product that the other alone would not achieve. Too much refined sugar and the product tends to ""granulate"" and the taste is too sweet. Too much corn syrup and some of the flavor of the fruit is lost. The ratio is adjusted for each flavor to get just the right proportion.

In today's world, a continuous tradition of excellence is remarkably rare. And you'll find the results of this tradition are simply delicious!

Evoo And Vin, LLC;"EVOO & Vin offers one of the largest selections of gourmet olive oils and balsamic vinegars in Dallas. We offer a unique try before you buy concept. 

EVOO & Vin (Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Vinegars) is a Dallas based business started by two friends who wanted to create a business that centered around our passion for cooking. After using Veronica Foods products in our home, we contacted the company about opening a location in Dallas to provide these high quality, great tasting products. Our concept is to not only offer these great tasting extra virgin olive oils and aged balsamic vinegars, but to show people how to use them in their everyday cooking. Our store and website are a showcase of over 100 recipes that highlight how to cook with every product we offer.
At EVOO & Vin you will have an opportunity to taste and compare over 50 varieties of the finest imported Ultra-Premium extra virgin olive oils, fused/ infused olive oils, Specialty oils, and aged balsamic vinegars. At our unique Tasting Bar our olive oils and balsamic vinegars are held in stainless steel Fusti’s from Italy, to preserve and protect their individual flavors ensuring the freshest available extra virgin olive oils and aged balsamic vinegars.
We strongly believe that extra virgin olive oil is like fruit juice: highly perishable, healthier and more flavorful when consumed fresh. This is one of the reasons why we post the harvest date on every oil we offer.
Our olives are grown and pressed by artisans and farmers from around the world, our balsamic vinegars are harvested in Modena, Italy, imported to our store and bottled on the premises on a taste first, bottle to order, basis. Our olive oils are 100% Ultra-Premium extra virgin, unfiltered and settled. Our balsamic vinegars are produced in the traditional Modena style, and they are aged in wooden barrels for up to 18 years.
In addition to the harvest date, we are extremely fanatical when it comes to the ""chemistry” of our olive oils. The chemistry of a particular oil can tell you many things. By testing an oil, we can learn many things from the polyphenol count (antioxidant value), the measurement which dictates flavor intensity, to whether it's suitable for high heat cooking, based on its unique free fatty acid measurement and fruit condition. We also measure oleic acid in our oils, the monounsaturated fat in Olive Oil that makes it so healthy.
Our products do not contain any preservatives, chemicals or additives. Everyone from novice cook, to seasoned chef can enjoy a healthy flavorful lifestyle. We hope you enjoy these products and the recipes as much as we do. ";manta

Miller's Homemade Jam;"Our family got our start cooking jams, jellies, and butters in stock pots on mom's kitchen stove.  The heartwarming smell of simmering apple butter wafting through the entire house is forever a part of our childhood memories. 
In the second generation almost 30 years later, not much has really changed at Mrs. Miller’s.  The kettles may have grown a bit larger, and the selection of flavors has increased. But the old-time recipes, simple fresh ingredients, and the delicious homemade taste remain a staple in every hand-scooped batch, which are still canned on our home acres in Ohio’s Amish Country.  
We believe authentic homemade jams should stand out from other options in the market, which is why we choose to make our jams with fresh wholesome fruits, real cane sugar, and GMO- free ingredients.  One of our highest compliments that we regularly receive from our customers is that our butters and jams ""taste just like what I remember from my grandma’s cooking."" 
Although we began with the traditional flavors such as apple butter, strawberry, and black raspberry, today our customers enjoy over 70 of our different varieties of jams, jellies, & butters.  Some of our unique varieties include flavors such as guava, tomato, mint and even dandelion jelly, which derives its popular flavor from the yellow dandelion blossoms picked in local fields during the spring.  There’s also a no sugar lineup, pepper jellies, and so many more to choose from.  No matter your favorite flavor, Mrs Miller’s is sure to carry it and we promise you it will taste just like you remembered it from your grandmother’s kitchen.";homepage

Uncle Bob’s original recipe is over a century old and comes from the Hills of Tennessee. It’s a vinegar based sauce that was created during the time of ice-box refrigeration when space was limited and freshness of the essence. The vinegar base is an all-natural preservative giving UB’s a long and stable shelf-life that, like wine, gets better with time! The best part of all? Uncle Bob’s never requires refrigeration even after you open it, so it’s ready to go when you are ready to eat – no matter where you are!  ";homepage

Grins Enterprises, LLC;"The challenge came from a school food service manager: Make a beverage that will appeal to high school kids’ discerning palates, but that won’t load them down with the high sugar and sodium doses found in many of their preferred drinks.A few months later, Ed Battle brought samples to Forsyth Country Day School in Lewisville, N.C.“They went nuts for it,” he said.All of a sudden, Battle found himself with a beverage that pleased everyone who tried it—adults and kids alike—but nothing to call it.After racking his brain for a name that expressed the positivity and optimism he wanted to send into schools with each bottle of his new product, Battle finally chose the simple expression we all wear when something quenches our thirst, touches our heart or removes a roadblock in our days—a grin.
Grins is a better-for-you beverage with no artificial flavors or colors. It has no caffeine, no carbonation and it meets the high school beverage standards set by the American Beverage Association.With just 50 calories per 8-ounce serving, real sugar for sweetness, fruit and vegetable juices for color and knockout flavor, Grins has plenty to make both teenagers and parents smile.Nathan Battle, a former teacher, coach and administrator at Forsyth Country Day, was so drawn in by the idea that he switched careers to become Grins’ operations manager, known around the office as “Director of Fun.”“Starting a business is hard work, but at the end of the day, you’re driving home and you’re thinking, ‘I’m selling Grins,’” he said. “You can’t have a bad day selling Grins.”
Grins the beverage is about hydrating consumers by providing an option that tastes great, so they’ll choose it over more sugary soft drinks and sports drinks that aren’t as good for them.But that’s just the beginning.Grins has pledged to give a percentage of its gross revenues from sales of beverages, apparel and other products to a variety of charities that help children and families who are going through difficult times in their lives.“There are a lot of people who need grins more than we do, and we want to help them,” Ed Battle said.
Grins also wants to help schools. The Grin and Share It! program helps educators and students raise money for the materials, activities and experiences that contribute to a strong education.
Grins is available in 16.9-ounce bottles in a growing number of retail outlets. Find a full, updated list of where to buy Grins here. The list of school districts serving Grins in 12-ounce bottles is growing by the week. Learn more about which schools serve Grins here.

Rafters 7s, LLC;"ve been making jelly for years. First, for my family and as gifts to friends. Then I began selling it at Farmer's Markets and craft shows. Several people commented that my jellies were the best they had ever tasted, and that I should sell them in stores.  So after much thought and research, Rafter 7S was started.
Rafter 7S is located 30 miles north of Paxton, Nebraska, in the heart of the Nebraska Sandhills. It is in cattle country on a real working ranch. We work with my husband's parents. A common question I am asked is “Where does the name Rafter 7S come from?” The name ""Rafter 7S"" comes from our cattle brand. The brand was first registered by my husband's grandfather. The company consists of my husband, Dean, me(Sherri) and our children (Kate, Mara, and Clay). 
Our specialty is pepper jelly. Have you ever tried pepper jelly? The most popular way to serve it is over cream cheese with crackers. It is also good mixed with sour cream and used as a dip, or as a relish with meats.  Stir it in any salad for a little extra taste. View our recipe page for more ideas. Our pepper jellies are very unique. There are eight varieties available. Some are not found anywhere else. Check out the products page for the unusual varieties such as Strawberry Jalapeno and Holiday Habanero.  The peppers used in our products are all grown locally.  We hand pick only the finest peppers for our products.
Also try our wild fruit jellies and syrups.  They are made with native Nebraska berries.  We hand pick the wild fruit at peak ripeness for the best flavor.  Many customers have stated that our wild plum and wild chokecherry jelly remind of the jellies that their grandma used to make for them.  They now purchase it and give to their grandparents as gifts.
My jelly is made the old fashioned way, in small hand stirred batches. They contain no corn syrup or preservatives.  The actual making of the jelly is done by my kids and me. 
Give our jellies a try. Once you savor the down-home flavor, you will begin to imagine you are visiting us right here at the ranch!";homepage

Elliott's Amazing Juices;"The first bottle of Elliott's Amazing Apple Juice was bottled in March 1983. However, I had made and sold Elliott's Old Fashioned Lemonade and Orangeade business in 1978 which only made it six months.  This was packed in paper milk cartons which had to be refrigerated and distributed in refrigerated trucks. I had an old milk truck-a wreck of an old milk truck- that had to be plugged in every night. First the compressor went and when the transmission went, I drove a stake into the radiator and had it towed away.
 
 
Little paper milk cartons...well before little plastic bottles were available.
 
Then in 1982, With a $9,000 a cider mill press and filter the juice then pump it into tank trucks and transported to a small brewery in South Jersey. There the juice was bottled in the generic stubby , brown beer bottles used by the brewery. I bought a used beer truck in North Jersey and had to sit around while a clutch was installed and then drove it back in the dark on the NJ Turnpike. The neighbors were not too happy with the truck parked in front of our house so I found a garden center around the corner who let me park the truck in a fenced in area.  One night kids ripped a hole in the roof of the truck and heisted some cases of what they thought was beer. The truck did have a Schmidt's Beer decal all over the front and sides. They were disappointed. I had to find a warehouse and park the truck inside. 
I then once again sold the cases of apple juice myself to about 500 accounts in Philadelphia before finding a soda distributor interested in selling the juices along with their carbonated beverages. Soon Elliott's Amazing apple juice in the little brown beer bottle was available in 18 states.
Elliott's Apple Juice..we had trademark conflict problem and added another word to make everyone happy. We started at the beginning of the alphabet and stopped at ""A"" for ""amazing"".
 
The little brown beer bottle is long gone and many more companies are now in the juice business.
 
The 20 foot inflatable was a lot of fun to put up. Once we put them up on the traffic circle leading to Cape Cod and the police made us take it down because we were slowing up traffic!

Our bottle caps have had ""famous quotes"" printed inside since 1983. In fact, I had to go down to the art department at out cap supplier and work with them on a technique to allow us to print a different quote under each of the caps since they had never done that before. So Nantucket Nectar's  ""interesting facts about Nantucket"" and Snapple's ""amazing facts"" was not innovative. Snapple's Amazing Facts was a direct rip off of our labels which had featured ""amazing facts"" for 10 years. We make the best juice possible using quality ingredients under clean, sanitary conditions.
 Elliott's Amazing juices are certified kosher. And we are one of the few companies that make an OU certified grape juice product.

Many companies make juice. They have clever names, fantastic graphics, but when you read the ingredient statement you often see ""filler juices"" such as white grape, pear and pineapple which are cheaper than the ""named juice"" on the label. Many people are mislead by 100% juice expecting to find the ""better-good for you juices as the predominate juice. Some companies mislabel the juice using the name of the more desirable, expensive juice first in the name such as Pomegranate- Plum when it really should be named Plum-Pomegranate. A large orange juice company calls it's orange juice made from concentrate ""100% Squeezed Orange Juice from Concentrate."" 
With Elliott's you get what you pay for and the result is superior taste.  Taste is everything according to the below chart.

Elliott's Amazing was selected as the exclusive juice in Barnes and Noble Cafes for over 5 years.
We've lead the way with flavors such as Orange Mango,  Strawberry Margarita, Grape Boysenberry, Carrot Carumba, and reduced calorie items using low glycermic index crystalline fructose and  SPLENDA® sucralose offers 1/2 the calories of our regular Cranberry, Orange Mango and Lemonade beverages.
Elliott's Amazing may not be the biggest juice brand, but people who love juice know it's the best!";homepage
Windstone Farms;"Back in 1985,  WindStone Farm located in Central Kentucky, planted their first crop of thornless blackberries. Two years of abundant sunshine, just the right amount of rain, and lots of tender loving care bore fruit. Blackberries by the bushel full were harvested and sold through our local farmers markets. Even though these juicy Kentucky berries were talked about everywhere, there were only so many blackberry cobblers and jam cakes that could be made in a week. So hundreds of pounds of granulated sugar, boxes upon boxes of quart jars were purchased and each plump berry was hand picked, then slowly simmered w/ sugar and WindStone Farms began making the their fruitful WindStone Farms Blackberry Jam.
Billy Gatton had recently sold his stake in a large Midwestern food brokerage company named SELL, INC, that had multiple offices. His expertise included sales, marketing and merchandising specialty grocery-type items for 31 years, began to produce the delicious wildly popular WindStone Farms Blackberry Jam from berries grown on the farm’s 8 foot tall thornless vines. Each berry was hand picked, then slowly simmered with granulated sugar, always in small batches – and never with any preservatives.  The Jam became a perfect ingredient in entrees, sauces, dressings,  cobblers, jam cakes and  other deserts… but was then and is today best enjoyed by just spooning it on warm bread and savoring the incredible blackberry taste.

Kentucky Proud is not only a way to provide safe and nutritious foods for your loved ones, but it is an investment in Kentucky’s land, people and its future.
The certified “Kentucky Proud” Jam, is now distributed throughout the mid-south as a regional favorite in at least 1,000 stores- for recipes, gift giving, and as a popular pantry shelf necessity.  The Jam is produced by Algood Foods, a Kentucky Company in Lawrenceburg, Ky. – which adheres exactly to the same “small batch” cooking techniques developed in your grandmothers kitchen way back when!
In December of 2011 Algood Food Co. bought the license to sell WindStone Farms Jams and Preserves and have been making the jam for the past 14 years. Algood will continue to carry on with the same quality that people have come to love in WindStone Farms Jam.
